# View Rollover
## Info
This mod will allow you to keep your excess views from the previous quota.<br>
Ex. If you end day 3 with 3.9K / 3K views, then you would keep the extra 900 views.

## Disclaimer
Due to how the game stores views, your views will not rollover at a 1:1 ratio.<br>
Using the previous example (in info), instead of having 900 views the next day you would have 796.
